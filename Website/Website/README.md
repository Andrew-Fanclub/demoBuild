Main Repo for the stuffs

Keep in mind look at the different Readme I made called AFCReadme.md

New additions to most recent version:
- Finished routes
- Web pages made (just needs styling and then after backend dev we can use webhooks)
- Dockerfile made in case we plan on using two servers for frontend and backend
